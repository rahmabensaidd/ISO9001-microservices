OGDev-Coconsult: Quality Management System (QMS) Digital Platform
Overview
OGDev-Coconsult is a digital platform designed to manage a Quality Management System (QMS) in compliance with the ISO 9001 standard. It automates, centralizes, and enhances accessibility for managing documents, processes, audits, indicators, and other critical QMS components. The platform ensures continuous improvement and alignment with ISO 9001 clauses.
Key Technologies

Backend: Spring Boot (Java 17) - Provides a robust REST API for resource management.
Frontend: Angular (TypeScript, Angular CLI 19+) - Offers an intuitive and responsive user interface.
Authentication: Keycloak (v26.1.2+) - Manages secure user authentication and role-based access.
Local Development: XAMPP - Hosts the MySQL database and Apache server for local development.
Dependencies: Maven (3.8+) for backend, npm (8+) for frontend.

Objectives

Automation: Streamline the generation of mandatory QMS documents.
Centralization: Provide a single platform for managing processes, audits, and indicators.
Accessibility: Ensure an intuitive interface for various user profiles (management, quality, employees).
Compliance: Align with ISO 9001 clauses and facilitate internal/external audits.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:

OGDEVS_AI_Back: Backend code (Spring Boot).
OGDEVSBack_[nomPrenomClasseExamen]: Additional backend resources or configurations.
OGDEVSFront: Frontend code (Angular), located at OGDevsFront/Backoffice/rizz-angular-v1.1.0/rizz-angular-v1.1.0.

Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure the following are installed:

Java 17: For the Spring Boot backend.
Maven 3.8+: For managing backend dependencies.
Node.js 16+ and npm 8+: For the Angular frontend.
Angular CLI 19+: For frontend development.
XAMPP: For hosting the MySQL database and Apache server locally.
Keycloak 26.1.2+: For authentication (can be run via Docker).
Docker: Optional, for running Keycloak.

Installation
1. Clone the Repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd OGDev-Coconsult

2. Set Up the Backend (Spring Boot)

Navigate to the backend directory:cd OGDEVS_AI_Back


Install dependencies:mvn install


Configure the database connection in application.properties to use XAMPP's MySQL (default port: 3306).
Run the application:mvn spring-boot:run

The backend will run on http://localhost:8089.

3. Set Up the Frontend (Angular)

Navigate to the frontend directory:cd OGDevsFront/Backoffice/rizz-angular-v1.1.0/rizz-angular-v1.1.0


Install dependencies:npm install --legacy-peer-deps


Start the development server:ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4200

The frontend will be accessible at http://localhost:4200

4. Set Up XAMPP

Start XAMPP and enable Apache and MySQL:
Open the XAMPP Control Panel.
Click "Start" for Apache and MySQL.


Verify MySQL is running on localhost:3306 and create a database if needed.

5. Set Up Keycloak

Run Keycloak via Docker:docker run -p 8080:8080 quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:26.1.2 start-dev


Access http://localhost:8080, set up an admin user, and configure a realm.
Update backend and frontend configurations to integrate with Keycloak.

Usage

Ensure XAMPP (Apache and MySQL), Keycloak, backend, and frontend are running.
Access the application at http://localhost:8089.
Log in with Keycloak credentials.
Use the platform to manage QMS processes and generate reports.

Important Notes

Innovation: Teams should prioritize creative and functional enhancements.
Task Distribution: Distribute modules fairly among team members.
Ergonomics and Security: Focus on user-friendly design and robust security (via Keycloak).
Advanced Features: Consider adding decision-support statistics or innovative functionalities.
